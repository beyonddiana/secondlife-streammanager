Stream Changer for SecondLife.

### How do I get set up? ###

  1. Add the manager script to your object that the dj sits on. Add a notecard named 'live' containing the live stream. Add the radio stream to the object description.
  2. Add the changer script to a box that you deed to the group on group owned land.

Then sit on the manager object to change the stream to live, unsit to set radio stream.
