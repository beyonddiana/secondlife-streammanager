# Simple Stream Manager for SecondLife #

This is a simple Stream Changer for SecondLife. It is useful for hangouts and clubs that have a radio stream and a live stream.

### How do I get set up? ###

  1. Add the manager script to your object that the dj sits on. Add a notecard named 'live' containing the live stream. Add the radio stream to the object description.
  2. Add the changer script to a box that you deed to the group on group owned land, hide this away nearby.

To change the stream to the live stream: sit on the manager object. When unsitting the stream will change back to the radio stream.
